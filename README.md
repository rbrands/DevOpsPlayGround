Project to play around with Azure DevOps.

The Git workflow follows the "Release Flow" as used by Microsoft and described in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/devops-at-microsoft/release-flow

With Azure DevOps CI is implemented - every commit to branch "master" will be compiled and deployed to slot "dev" in Azure Web App https://devopsplayground-dev.azurewebsites.net/
